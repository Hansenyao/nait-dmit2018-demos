// Aggregates In-Class exercise

// Question 1: Count()
// Context: The marketing department at Contoso Corporation is planning a new campaign targeted at families. 
// To effectively tailor their messaging and offers, they need to understand the size of their customer base that has children.
// Specifically, they want to count how many of their customers have at least one child. This data will help them focus their 
// efforts on a segment of customers who are most likely to be interested in family-oriented products and services.
// Objective: How would you write a query to count the number of customers who have one or more children? 
// The query should filter the Customers table to find those with a TotalChildren value greater than 0 and return the total count.
Customers
	.Count(customer => customer.TotalChildren > 0)
	.Dump();
	
// Or
Customers
	.Where(customer => customer.TotalChildren > 0)
	.Count()
	.Dump();


// Question 2: Count()
// Context: The HR department is conducting a salary review to identify the number of employees earning a high base rate. 
// They are particularly interested in understanding how many employees have a base rate higher than $70 per hour. 
// This analysis will help determine if the company needs to adjust its compensation strategy.
// Objective: How would you write a query to count the number of employees whose base rate is greater than $70 per hour? 
// The query should filter the Employees table to find those with a BaseRate value greater than 70 and return the total count.
Employees
	.Count(employee => employee.BaseRate > 70)
	.Dump();
// Or
Employees
	.Where(employee => employee.BaseRate > 70)
	.Count()
	.Dump();

// Question 3: Sum()
// Context: The inventory management team at Contoso Corporation is assessing the stock levels across all product lines.
// They need to generate a report that lists each product along with the total quantity on hand across all store locations 
// ordered by name.This information will be critical for planning inventory restocking and managing product availability 
// across different regions.
// Objective: How would you write a query to retrieve the name of each product and the total quantity on hand? 
// The query should calculate the sum of the OnHandQuantity for each product, and if a product has no inventory records, 
// it should return a quantity of 0, ordered by name.
// NOTE: You will have to use the Ternary Operator to check if there is any inventory for the product.
Products
	.Select(product => new {
		Name = product.ProductName,
		Total = product.Inventories.Count() == 0 ? 0 : product.Inventories.Sum(inventory => inventory.OnHandQuantity)
	})
	.OrderBy(anon => anon.Name)
	.Dump();


// Question 4: Sum()
// Context: The marketing department needs to calculate the total discount amount applied under each promotion to assess 
// its effectiveness, ordered by promotion name.
// Objective: How would you use LINQ to sum the total DiscountAmount for each promotion, ordered by promotion name using 
// navigation properties in the Promotion table ?
Promotions
	.Select(promotion => new {
		PromtionID = promotion.PromotionID,
		PromtionName = promotion.PromotionName,
		TotalDiscountGiven = promotion.InvoiceLines.Sum(invoice => invoice.DiscountAmount)
	})
	.OrderBy(anon => anon.PromtionName)
	.Dump();


// Question 5: Min()
// Context: The product pricing team at Contoso Corporation is reviewing the pricing structure of their various product lines.
// They need to identify the lowest product cost and price within each subcategory to ensure competitive pricing and profitability.
// This analysis will help them adjust prices where necessary and identify opportunities for cost reduction.
// Objective: How would you write a query to retrieve the lowest unit cost and price for each product subcategory ? 
// The query should select the ProductCategory and ProductSubcategory names, along with the minimum UnitCost and UnitPrice 
// for products in each subcategory.The results should only include subcategories where both the lowest cost and price are 
// available and should be ordered by product category name.
ProductSubcategories
	.Where(sub => sub.Products.Count() > 0)
	.Select(sub => new {
		Category = sub.ProductCategory.ProductCategoryName,
		SubCateory = sub.ProductSubcategoryName,
		LowestCost = sub.Products.Min(product => product.UnitCost),
		LowestPrict = sub.Products.Min(product => product.UnitPrice)
	})
	.OrderBy(anon => anon.Category)
	.Dump();


// Question 6: Min()
// Context: The finance department at Contoso Corporation is conducting an audit of their store operations and needs to identify 
// the oldest invoice date for each store. This information will help them review the longevity of business transactions and ensure 
// that records are maintained appropriately across all stores.
// Objective: How would you write a query to retrieve the oldest invoice date for each store? The query should return the StoreID, 
// StoreName, and the oldest invoice date formatted as a string. If no invoices exist for a store, the result should display 'N/A' 
// for the date. The results should be ordered alphabetically by the store name.
Stores
	.Select(store => new {
		StoreID = store.StoreID,
		Name = store.StoreName,
		OldestInvoice = store.Invoices.Min(invoice => invoice.DateKey) == null ? 
						"N/A" : store.Invoices.Min(invoice => invoice.DateKey).ToShortDateString()
	})
	.OrderBy(anon => anon.Name)
	.Dump();


// Question 7: Max()
// Context: The product pricing team at Contoso Corporation is conducting a detailed analysis of product costs and prices across various 
// subcategories. They aim to understand the pricing range within each subcategory by identifying the minimum and maximum unit costs and 
// prices of products. This information is crucial for assessing pricing strategies and identifying opportunities for margin improvements.
// Objective: How would you write a query to retrieve the lowest and highest unit costs and prices for each product subcategory? 
// The query should return the ProductCategory name, SubCategory name, LowestCost, LowestPrice, MaxCost, and MaxPrice. 
// The results should be filtered to exclude subcategories without cost or price information and should be ordered by category name.
ProductSubcategories
	.Where(sub => sub.Products.Count() > 0)
	.Select(sub => new {
		Category = sub.ProductCategory.ProductCategoryName,
		SubCategory = sub.ProductSubcategoryName,
		LowestCost = sub.Products.Min(p => p.UnitCost),
		LowestPrice = sub.Products.Min(p => p.UnitPrice),
		MaxCost = sub.Products.Max(p => p.UnitCost),

	.Dump();


// Question 8: Max()
// Context: The finance team at Contoso Corporation is conducting a review of sales performance across their stores. 
// They are particularly interested in identifying the highest invoice amounts recorded at each store. This data will help the team 
// understand the potential revenue from top transactions and assess store-level performance.

// The query should return the StoreID, StoreName, and the LargestInvoiceAmount. The results should be ordered alphabetically by store name.
Stores
	.Select(store => new {
		StoreID = store.StoreID,
		Name = store.StoreName,
		LargestInvoiceAmount = store.Invoices.Count() == 0 ? 
							   0 : store.Invoices.Max(invoice => invoice.TotalAmount)
	})
	.OrderBy(anon => anon.Name)
	.Dump();


// Question 9: Average()
// Context: The sales analysis team at Contoso Corporation is interested in understanding the average quantity of items sold per invoice. 
// This data will help them assess sales patterns and identify opportunities for improving sales strategies. By calculating the average 
// quantity of items sold across all invoices, the team can better understand customer purchasing behaviors.
// Objective: How would you write a query to calculate the average quantity of items sold for each invoice? The query should return the 
// InvoiceNo, InvoiceDate, and the AverageQty of items sold per invoice.
Invoices
	.Select(invoice => new {
		InvoiceNo = invoice.InvoiceID,
		InvoiceDate = invoice.DateKey.ToShortDateString(),
		AverageQty = Math.Floor(invoice.InvoiceLines.Average(line => line.SalesQuantity))
